Wasn't an easy decision, but I just removed my LVM partition for you, Arch Linux.

Sorry I had to do this. You were definitely one of the best OS I've ever used. (And I'm going to miss your package manager and AUR, oh god.) Sure, tinkering with dotfiles, trying all sort of window managers were damn fun. But I think I need to move on to, you know, more ‘stable’ OS.

Oops. Didn’t mean to say you were unstable. Indeed, you were only unstable after I installed packages and tried configs without me learning about them, and even then, it can be easily fixed after we spent the time.

But that’s exactly it, I don’t have the time anymore. I don’t have the time to think ‘I wonder what are the configs for this app/package’, or ‘how do I extend this app to do what I want’, even though I loved to do it. Truly, I do. I wish I have the time.

These past 3 months I’ve been using you in a new hardware, 2015 MBPR. Yes, I double-timed you with OS X. This wasn’t like the time when I did it with Windows, though. I prefer you over what Windows can give me. I just used it, sometimes, for my games that were still there. With OS X? I put you in that machine intentionally, because I really do care about you.

I really wanted you to work. I tried everything.

But you didn’t. OS X may have its inferior package manager, but it’s still usable. It might not have the amazing customizability like you did, but the ‘prison’ it gave me was made of gold. I actually _did not_ have to customize. Everything just works.

Also, OS X is deeply integrated with the hardware. The track pad? Flawless. Godly amazing. I can do gestures and everything. I tried to make the same config with you, but I found no good enough answer.

And the battery management. I still remember those nights comparing the battery life under OS X and you (+ `tlp`). I don’t know if it’s me, but OS X gives me way better battery life every single time. What can I say, but uptime length _does_ matter.

And recently I have these 2 new accessories. Bluetooth headphones and mouse. I remembered how HARD is it to set up 1 single bluetooth device with you. Was it `blues` or `bluetoothctl`? I can’t even remember what mantras I chanted before to get A2DP work on our last headphones.

All in all, I’m really sorry. It’s not you. It’s definitely me. If anyone asks me what my favorite Linux distro is, I’ll answer it with you. Every time. But for now, I’m going to work, play, and create stuff with OS X.

When later I meet someone with you in a coffee shop, I’ll nod at them and be happy cause they picked the right thing. Maybe I’ll even talk with them about my experiences with you. But until then, I will miss you from far away. You’ll always be in a special place in my life.
